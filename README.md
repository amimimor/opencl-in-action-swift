#OpenCL in Action

Matthew Scarpino's Book, *OpenCL in Action: How to accelerate graphics and computation*, is an excellent resource for learning OpenCL. Code is provided with the book and can be obtained from [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/scarpino2/). 

I am developing and learning OpenCL on the Mac platform, and so am reimplementing the code from each chapter utilising Xcodes built in frameworks to make host development easier.

Controlling OpenCL on the host became a lot easier with [Interoperation with Grand Central Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/OpenCL_MacProgGuide/SynchronizingCLandGL/SynchronizingCLandGL.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008312-CH18-SW1). Thus I am using as simplified development as possible while using Swift on the host
